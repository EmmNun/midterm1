                    <p>Volleyball was created in 1895 by William G. Morgan in the United States. Originally called "mintonette," the sport was developed as a less intense alternative to basketball for older members of the YMCA.</p>
                    <p>Morgan, a YMCA physical education director in Holyoke, Massachusetts, designed the game to combine elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball. The first rules called for a net 6 feet 6 inches high, a court of unlimited players, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each side.</p>

                    <p>Volleyball quickly spread internationally after its creation. By 1900, Canada had already adopted the game, and in 1913, the first official volleyball competition was held in the Far Eastern Games.</p>
                    <p>The Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) was founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women. Volleyball became an Olympic sport in 1964 at the Tokyo Games.</p>
                    <p>Today, volleyball is played by more than 800 million people worldwide, making it one of the most popular sports globally. The sport has evolved into different variations, including beach volleyball, which became an Olympic sport in 1996.</p>
